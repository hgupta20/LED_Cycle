  Description: 
  Use the onboard LED on pin 13, a red LED on a second digital pin of your choice and a green LED on a third
  digital pin of your choice.
  Have these three LEDâ€™s cycle so only one LED is on at any given point in time. 
  So your onboard LED should turn on, then it should turn off and your red LED should turn on, 
  then it should turn off and your green LED should turn
  on, then onboard, then red, then green, etc . . .
  The digital pins should be labeled 0-13 on your board.
  Each off-board LED should be connected to a 220 Ohm resistor.
