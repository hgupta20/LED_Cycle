# LED_Cycle
Have three LEDâ€™s cycle so only one LED is on at any given point in time. So your onboard LED should turn
on, then it should turn off and your red LED should turn on, then it should turn off and your green LED should turn
on, then onboard, then red, then green, etc . . .
The digital pins should be labeled 0-13 on your board.
Each off-board LED should be connected to a 220 Ohm resistor.
Note that this will mean you have to connect two separate LEDs to the ground pin. I recommend using a
breadboard for this.
